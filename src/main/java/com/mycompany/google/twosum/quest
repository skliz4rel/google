Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add
up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not
use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1]


Algorithm
1. Begin
2. Create an array to have to int values spaces. Name it answer
3. Sort the nums arrays that you are given.
3. Loop through the numbers array.
4. create a variable to store the second number.
5. Substract the number you read while looping through the nums array.
6. Do a Arrays.binarySearch to find the result of the substraction index position.
7. If index position is greater than -1.
8. add the index of the found number and the current position in the answer array, based on an ascending order.
9. call the break statement to exit the array.
10. End.
