There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should
be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
The median is 2.0
Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.


Algorithm
Begin
1. create a variable to store nums1 array and nums2 array
2. store size of nums1 and nums2
3. Sums the two size store in total numbers.
4. calculate if total is a old or even number.
5. create a sigle while loop to find the center number.
6. while in the loop if old. terminate at the center number
7. inside the while loop extract the 2 center even and exit with a break statement.
8. calculate the sum and divide by 2.
END.
