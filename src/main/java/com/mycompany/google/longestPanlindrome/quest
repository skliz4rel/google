Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume
that the maximum length of s is 1000.
Example 1:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"


Algorithm
1 Begin
2. Accept the string
3. Create a int variable longestLen
4. Create a unigue loop that reads from front to end   and Back to Front.
5. While you iterating. create 3 unique strong string.
Substring1 :  Front to end
Substring2 : End to Front.
Substring3: Inbetween the two pointers used.
6. Reverse all the the 3 strings and check if they are palindromes.
7. Use your if statement to store the longest values of the palindromes.
8. Terminate the loop when the startPointer and endPointer each get to the center.
9. End.
